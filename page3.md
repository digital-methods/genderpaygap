# Limitations
## Semantic network of repetitive comments, users and videos
 
<p> We were unable to clearly link repetitive comments to the users making them and the videos in which they appeared. Doing so would provide a clearer representation of how commenters interact with the videos, notably the degree to which commenters post the same thing repeatedly on one video and multiple videos. This would be interesting as it would show the degree to which commenters participate in the opportunities YouTube offers for ‘communities of discussion’.</p>
<p> This type of analysis does not tell you why commenters choose to post multiple times. It shows us that people do interact with a community of other users. However, it does not show whether this is deliberate or  due to the face that a commented on different videos after watching a few in a playlist. </p>
<p> We also do not analyse the degree to which commenters respond to one another’s comments. This would be interesting as it would show how much ‘discussion’ is occurring as opposed to just commenting. </p>

## General limitations
<p>We do not analyse whether there is a difference between comments on videos from media sites, such as CNN, and individual YouTube content creators (individuals who create vlogs or videos themselves). Given that individual YouTube content creators arguably have a smaller audience, you could say that users who comment on these videos from are participating in a smaller community, in which they may be more personally interested in and therefore more likely to actively engage through comments. This intern may influence the kind of discussion taking place. </p>

<p> This kind of analysis does not tell you the opinions or attitudes of users who do not comment but do watch the videos. Therefore, it is representative only for users who choose to engage with YouTube in this way (Thelwell, 2017). </p>

<p> Current vocabularies do not pick up slang, emojis, and seem particularly bad for irony and sarcasm, all prominent within YouTube comments and online discourse in general. For that reason, we were unable to successfully perform sentiment analysis of the comments, as it produced unintelligible results. </p>

<p> As noted an additional limitation is that one video provided 49.5% of our comments. In this video Jordan Peterson provided evidence to disprove the gender pay gap, and the female journalist was widely criticised for her aggressive interview style. This popularity of this video potentially skews our the results of our analysis towards those views that also seek to disprove the gender pay gap. As noted though, as the number of disproving videos suggests that the negativity seen the in comments can still be attributed to the dataset as a whole. </p>

## Semantic network: adjectives and nouns

<p> As words are expressed without context, one cannot tell whether certain words are expressed in negative or positive sense, such as “equal” and “rape”. In this case, even the connecting words do not necessarily imply the connotation of the word, as YouTube comments are expressed often in a manner where no clear differentiation without context can be made between positive and negative. </p>
<p> Similarly, Cortext cannot differentiate between sarcasm and for instance quotes. Some commenters can for example quote opposite opinion and argue further against, which can cause bias in the semantic network. </p>
 <p> Different levels of abstractions are now mixed together (such as feminism and factor), for a more “coherent” representation, one could form new categorisations and create different levels for analysis, such as concepts, people, values etc...and then compare the results with a demography map. This would, of course, create new biases but could still assist in assessing structured analysis in a new manner. </p>
