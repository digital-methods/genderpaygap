# Discussion
## Semantic network analysis: nouns and adjectives 

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/3bc4aba8411b3289fd4f627c0e23d563

<p> While the map looks somewhat cluttered at first sight, it reveals 13 quite distinct clusters, as listed below: <br /> 

1. Average & Earnings: discussions revolving around money <br />
2. Dumb & Fuck: This is likely related to comments that could be classified as ‘trolling’ and those related to ‘dooming’ gender pay gap. 
3. Scientific & Argument: This could relate to discussions refuting the existence of any scientific arguments for the validity of gender pay gap. <br />
4. News & Fake: Comments referring to gender pay gap as ‘fake news’. <br />
5. Equal & Rape: ‘Rape’ in the map connects to the terms sexual, false, domestic, legal. The emergence of the term in debates surrounding gender inequality is not all that surprising. However, its connection to ‘equal’ is somewhat ambiguous, but could be related to arguments for men facing gender inequality as well, i.e. arguments such as ‘Men get raped too’. <br />
6. Feminists & Feminist: While we separated these in terms, this mutual appearance could be due to the latter being an adjective. These terms appear together with words such as: third, oppressed, radical, western, which could indicate criticism towards feminism and labelling it as a particularly western phenomenon, also criticising its radical nature. <br />
7. Pregnant & Years: Relates to discussions on the topic of having babies, being a mother, and maternity [leave] months. Could be related to arguments explaining the gender pay gap due to women’s absence from work-life due to pregnancy. <br />
8. White & Race: white relates to words describing class differences whereas race to “white, black, human, racist”. Could refer to discussion on whether gender pay gap takes into account differences in income between different ethnicities. <br />
9. Unexplained & Due: arguments on wage gap is unexplainable and can be caused by different factors such as different choices. In addition the word “discrimination” is related to this cluster. <br />
10. Interview & Peterson: Most likely referring to the debate of Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman on gender pay gap, in videos 1, 66, and 89. <br />
11. Same & Less: Debates revolving around whether women really earn the same or less. <br />
12. Job & Higher: The pay gap between genders being related to differing education, job, position, and careers. <br />
13. Male & Female: An unsurprising cluster in a discussion revolving around gender inequalities. </p>

<p> Furthermore, on multiple accounts explanations other than gender discrimination are offered for the existence of such gap, for example women’s choices concerning their education, career, and family specifically related to maternity leave; possibly suggesting that the differences in pay are not due to being paid less for the same jobs but for women being prone for differing life-trajectories. </p>

<p> A second emerging theme is the discussion surrounding feminism, and its perceived excessive radical character in particular, with focus on comments about Third Wave Feminism. What is perhaps noticeable is that the discussion revolves around Third, not Fourth Wave feminism specifically, which could be due to it being perceived more moderate and reasonable than its successor. </p> 

## Commenters, videos, and comment repetition 
<p> In this section we looked at whether comments were repeated across videos, using two different maps. </p>

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/e46cac6266a05858ffdb6c75dce6c17d
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: 1000 nodes, author, video title, raw, proximity threshold 2 </font> <br />

<p> This map looks at videos and comments that appear at least twice. It does not link the comments to the author but shows that multiple videos often have the same kinds of comments, and that they might often lack depth or analytical, albeit, there are a number of longer comments, which can be observed through an examination of the interactive map.  </p>

<p> Nevertheless, there are also a number of longer comments that are repeated amongst the videos, and sometimes occur multiple times in the same video. This indicates that people are either posting on the one video with the same comment and or also posting that same comment on other videos. For example between ‘One woman discovers the gender pay gap’ and the ‘wage gap last week tonight video’ one user has posted the same youtube link which is another wag gap video (that is incidentally included in our corpus as well title of the video ‘but muh wage gap’). </p>

<p> The types of repeated comments vary, some of them being lengthy, while the majority bing single words like ‘lol’, or ‘feminism’ or even ‘0’ (from username Brocoli Assasin). However, what is notable is some comments’ paranoia-spreading nature, for example the user ‘Logic Monkey’ commenting more than once ‘Did you know roughly 50 top comments have been deleted thus far? that’s all of them… you are next’ and ‘Every single Top comments have been deleted since the video was posterd [sic] … like 70 so far. Go ahead start some conversation in the top comments… watch them get deleted… been watching it  for 6 weeks now. When they reach 2k-5k they are deleted. This is a copy and paste… been posting it for 6 weeks :\ ‘, this comment being on the ‘Jordan Peterson debate on gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism’, which we found by cross referencing the comment with the video titles on Map 2. </p>

### Map 2 
<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/faf17ebdf00fd1affacaa129eee96338
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: 1000 nodes, text, video title, raw, proximity threshold 2 </font> <br />

<p> This map links authors who commented the same thing more than once, this can either be the same comment on the one video, for example commenter Muck006 posts the comment beginning with ‘that is her interview style’ more than once on the video ‘Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism’. This might be spam but it shows users repeat their points across the same video. Also, there are examples where authors post the same comment on different videos, for example the comment starting with ‘ for every person (or feminist) reading this:’ (in the blue cluster of the top left corner of the map) has been posted on three different videos by the username ‘pietje bel’. This illustrates a repetitive manner of sharing their message by commenters, across several videos, indicating that these users are commenting in a fairly deliberate way rather than just spontaneously reacting to a video they watched. However, it is hard to see whether this deliberate commenting is motivated by a desire to combat a particular message or whether the user, after watching one video and commenting, fell into a trap of watching multiple videos and copy-pasting the same thing. At very least, this demonstrates a high level of interaction with the videos. </p>

## Semantic network analysis: videos and commentators

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/68152a37682690606dfc90cef9404155

<font size="2"> Specifics: "default" proximity measure and 10 labels and 150 nodes videos/commentators/adjectives map </font> <br />

<p> The map shows co-occurrences of commentators over videos. The three variables for the analysis were video title, commentator, and the 200 adjectives extracted as the third variable. The amount of nodes selected was 150, the proximity measure used was an indirect one, ‘distributional’, with heterogeneous edges. Ten labels were used for the third variable, in the map next to their respective clusters, and as listed below in the respective analyses of the four clusters that were formed, namely, Blue, Green, Turquoise, and Orange. </p> 

#### Blue:

<p> As we can observe, by a significant measure the largest cluster is the blue one, furthermore densely interconnected. There are three particularly large nodes in this discussion, corresponding to videos two, three, and four on our list of most viewed videos, namely ‘Wage Gap: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)’: <br />
  
  <object width="425" height="350">

‘The Myth of the Gender Wage Gap’ <br />

<object width="425" height="350">
  <param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqyrflOQFc" />
  <param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
  <embed src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqyrflOQFc"

</object><br />

<br /> The first of these is a show that covers recent events with a humoristic twist, the second a more neutral account laying out arguments, and the third a somewhat politicised account by a conservative digital media organisation, PragerU. What this variety of different types of videos perhaps illustrates is the complexity and controversiality of the issue, as well as the contribution of very different types of stakeholders into the discussion. </p> 

<p> The cluster is tagged by the following list of the 10 most co-occurring adjectives: <br />

1. Less <br />
2. More <br />
3. Same <br />
4. Illegal <br />
5. Average <br />
6. Lower <br />
7. Due <br />
8. Higher <br />
9. Equal <br />
10. Sexist </p> 

<p> Many of these adjectives are somewhat neutral or general without a specific context (such as less/more/same/average/lower/higher), and thus struggle to dominantly convey anything in particular. What we can perhaps derive from this is that the discussions are taking surrounding the legality of the gender pay gap. </p> 

#### Green: 

<p> The Green cluster is one formed around the most commented of the videos in our sample, having 99,690 comments relative to around 20,000 comments of the second most-viewed video of the sample. The high amount of comments is probably due to the video’s ‘Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism’ controversial nature, and that of Jordan Peterson discussing the gender pay gap on the video (reference). </p> 

<p> It was associated with the list of ten adjectives: <br />

1, Intelligent <br />
2. Good <br />
3. Stupid <br />
4. Dumb <br />
5. Bad <br />
6. Smart <br />
7. Idiot <br />
8. Poor <br />
9. Great <br />
10. Liberal </p> 

<p> This list of adjectives is, again, somewhat neutral, but seems to indicate value-judgements made on people, perhaps specifically on Jordan Peterson, and Cathy Newman, who is interviewing him on the video. These value judgements are also evident in the top comments such as ‘Jordan Peterson had his arm broken after the interview, because of all the high fives he got for owning the debate.’, ‘What is wrong with this woman....﻿’, and ‘Is this woman even capable of one sophisticated thought?﻿’. </p> 

##### Turquoise:

<p> The turquoise cluster seems to be centred around discussions on race, as among the ten most used nouns and adjectives are quite evidently race-related terms such as ‘racist’, ‘black’, ‘white’, and terms also often associated with related discussions, relating to socio-economic differences between races, with terms such as ‘poor’, ‘political’, and ‘economic’, as we can see listed below.  
<br />
1. Black <br />
2. Racist <br />
3. White <br />
4. Poor <br />
5. Own <br />
6. Liberal <br />
7. Old <br />
8. Political <br />
9. Economic <br />
10. Intelligent </p> 

#### Orange:

<p> The orange cluster, partly due to its smaller size, is somewhat more difficult to interpret. <br />

1. Higher <br />
2. Female <br />
3. Personal <br />
4. Funny <br />
5. Harder <br />
6. Less <br />
7. Nice <br />
8. Deal <br />
9. Dangerous <br />
10. Human </p> 


### Videos and commenters: Graph B

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/855edde2a6dd006ff50ab9fe24e9e016
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: Graph B was ran with the same parameters as Graph A, except for the utilisation or a different indirect distributional measure, namely, cosine_het. </font> <br />

### Videos and commenters: Graph C

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/5d25180c774b1c6146665dd21805deb1
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />

<p> The network was built with three variables of videotitle, commentator, and commentators. For this map the amount of nodes was set to 500, with ‘distributional’ proximity measure, heterogeneous edges. We again set ten labels for the third variable, in this case commentators. </p>

<p> Map C links videos with commentators, but instead of adjectives listing the top 10 commentators next to each cluster of videos. While the map looks somewhat cluttered at first sight, the clusters contain videos that the same top ten commentators have engaged with, as seen on the labels next to the clusters, forming small communities around this group of videos. What we can also observe is that some users, such as ‘John Smith’ participate in multiple clusters. </p>

### Videos and commenters: Graph D 

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/1fef13a8f723a276a2bdae434395d193
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />

We produced another map with the same settings, but using the chi2 proximity measure instead, thus using a direct instead of a direct measure, the indirect one taking into account only the number of raw co-occurrences between the two nodes and not global distribution. Thus, the map produced is generally similar but differently ordered. 


## Semantic network analysis: adjectives and adjectives (100)

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/cc501f7f59d062c1d64894a187743019 
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: log likelihood function and a 0.1 proximity measure and has 150 nodes.  </font> <br />


<p> We produced a semantic network mapping of the 100 most popular adjectives across comments. We can note the presence of several identifiable clusters, which reflect different general discussions using distinct vocabularies to express views on the gender-pay gap on YouTube. </p>

<p> One such discussion approaches race, containing the adjectives ‘racist, white, black, good, idiot, funny’ (dark blue and red). This indicates that race may be a central discussion, at least in certain hubs of the network. ‘White’ figures as a central node both in terms of betweenness and centrality (in the ‘top’ half of the network). Some other adjectives, relating to other social groups, are also linked to the race cluster while not central in this discussion, such as ‘poor’ or ‘straight’. </p>

<p> Another discussion (light blue) carries on feminism as such. Unsurprisingly, feminist is a central note both in terms of betweenness and centrality (in connects many nodes and is central when looking at the “top” of the network). In this discussion, ‘feminist’ is for a large part contextualised by its betweenness with ‘radical’, ‘liberal’ and ‘political’, ‘crazy’, and ‘false’. </p>

<p> Another discussion (orange), which is the widest in its clustering of most popular adjectives, seems to be centred on the quantitative, statistical aspect of the male-female gap, with central adjectives being ‘less’, ‘more’, ‘same’, ‘higher’, ‘lower’, ‘average’, ‘different’, ‘many’, ‘much’, etc. The neutral adjectives of the male – female binarity, forming a cluster of its own (green), is most firmly contextualised in the discussion on the quantitative/statistical aspect of the debate. </p>

<p> Lastly, the popularity per se of certain adjectives is worth commenting on. </p>

<p> The fact that straight appears as one of the 100 most popular adjectives across tens of thousands of comments, indicates that sexual orientation is brought up quite often. </p>

<p> The fact that adjectives such as sick, wrong, damn, worse, stupid, retard, dumb, idiot, crazy, etc. are among the 100 most prominent could indicate that the debate is quite polemic. </p>

## Semantic network analysis: adjectives and adjectives (200)

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/2c7183292aa0e1816820710eea952672 
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: log likelihood function and a 0.1 proximity measure and has 150 nodes. </font> <br />

<p> We produced a semantic network mapping of the 200 most popular adjectives across comments. This map allows us to analyse the semantic network mapping of the most popular adjectives further than the 100 adjectives mapping. </p>

<p> Firstly, two new discussion clusters appear, which overlap with each other : one discussion approaching social/natural/cultural causal adjectives (nodes: other (central), social, cultural, economic, human, natural, etc.) and the other normative judgement in moderated language (nodes : good (central), nice, worse, new, old, etc.). This may indicate that comments expressing a normative judgement in moderated language overlap with those that channel causal language (whether social, biological, or economic). Also, the fact that these clusters only appear in the 200 most popular adjectives and not in the 100 most popular adjectives mapping may indicate that the discussion with normative judgement in moderated language only comes in second place. </p>

<p> Otherwise, while we can find mostly the same clusters as in the 100 most popular adjectives mapping, some more detailed clustering is clarified by the increase to 200 adjectives. </p>

<p> Another cluster containing a binarity appears in the quantitative/statistical aspect of the male-female gap: the hard-easy binarity (green). Only ‘harder’ appeared in the 100 most popular adjectives mapping, and only as a minor node to the the quantitative/statistical cluster. This suggests that, while not more discussed than other quantitative/statistical aspects of the gap, arduousness forms a distinct cluster that is, like gender, talked about in binary terms. </p>


<p> The 200 most popular adjectives semantic network map clarifies that the race discussion already identified with the 100 most popular adjectives map is contextualised and mixed within the same cluster as a similar discussion on sexual orientation (gay, straight).

<p> As concerns the discussion on feminism as such, more adjectives contextualising feminism with a negative connotation appear such as ‘leftist’, ‘fake’, ‘angry’, ‘typical’, ‘dishonest’. </p>

<p> The 200 most popular adjectives semantic network map clarifies also clarifies that the feminism as such discussion is very proximate to the discussion on accuracy (nodes: stupid (central), dumb, ignorant, intelligent, smart, retarded, etc.), which connects this cluster, with the next focusing on sexual orientation and race. Meanwhile, the clusters on race/sexual orientation and accuracy are relatively distant to that on quantitative-statistical adjectives, suggesting that the quantitative/statistical discussion attracts less language on race/sexual orientation and accuracy than feminism as such. </p>

<p> A few adjectives serve as inter-cluster bridges, that is they have relatively weak (or few) ties, but they connect different clusters. </p>

<p> Firstly, ‘political’ connects the cluster of social/natural/cultural adjectives to the cluster on feminism as such. This reflects that it is an important adjective in both discussions and one of the few top adjectives connecting both. </p>

<p> Secondly, ‘white’ continues to be a fairly central note in terms of degree (albeit less than feminist). ‘White’ is contextualised both by the male-female binarity within the quantitative/statistical discussion and nodes in all other clusters, forming a unique link accross clusters, and indicating that whiteness is part of all discussions (albeit a small one). </p>


<p> Like the 100 most popular adjectives map, the network does not seem dense, and displays many structural holes. This is due to the use of the log-likelihood function (and not the ‘raw’ co-occurrences function). </p>


## Topic modeling with 5 topics 

<iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/a269/a269cab1006094d9789290d01d4bb2a6/73591/vislda.html 
" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1200" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br />
<font size="2"> Specifics: We produced an intertopic distance map displaying 5 topics (the first attempt, with 10 topics was inconclusive with regards to readability of the data’s topic modelling).  </font> <br />

<p> This map is informative regarding the proportion of speech in the comments carrying on the substance of the topic of the gender-pay gap (topic 1,2 and 4) and speech that is not very substantial, leaning towards trolling or youtube networking/jargon (topic 2 and topic 5). </p>

<p> Topic 1, the largest topic, is quite substantial and displays a fairly neutral list of terms, terms that we would substantially expect in debates about gender pay gap (men, women, gender, get, make, paid, money, child, equal, hour, study, work, gap, wage, etc.). </p>

<p> Topic 2 is still rather substantial and could be understood to be centred on the feminist discourse and its reception (people, feminist, think, know, want, say, feminism, mean, believe, wrong, etc.). </p>

<p> Topic 3 seems to relate to youtube networking and jargon (br, comment, source, see, this, read, love, oh question). </p>

<p> Topic 4 seems to be very holistic and encompasses societal topics at large (year, world, society, jesus, government, social, female, state, million, school, sport, opportunity, informaion, human, male). </p>

<p> Topic 5 contains mostly obscenities, insults or trolling language (fucking, bitch, shit, fuck, old, sorry, god, idiot, hell, etc.) </p>
