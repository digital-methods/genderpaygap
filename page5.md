# Some examples of Gender Pay Gap videos 


<p> To help us interpret our results, each video was classified as disproving, proving or neutral in its support for the gender pay-gap. We also observed whether the videos came from traditional media sites, such as CNN or Vox Media, or were from personal users, companies and research institutes.  Out of the 100 videos included in our analysis, 60 were negative, 31 were positive and the rest were neutral or in a language other than English. 44 were from traditional media sites, 46 were personal accounts, 5 were from a university or research institute, and the remaining were either in a language other than english or not classified. </p>

<p> While the number of videos from traditional media sites and personal accounts were relatively even, videos from traditional media sites made up the top 14 most viewed videos, encompassing 201678 comments. This means that 67 % of our comments were contained in the top 14 videos from traditional media. Out these top 14 videos were nine were supporting or neutral towards the gender pay gap, and five were disproving. However, the most viewed video and the video with the most comments, was disapproving of the gender pay gap, and also accounted for 99,960 comments - 49.5% of our comment set. </p>

<p> This video was an interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson and the BBC Journalist, Cathy Newman, after which Newman was highly criticised for her interview style. It is unsurprising that the videos from traditional media sites are the most video. Their audience is much wider. However, the fact that the first video makes up 49.5% of our comments potential skews our the results of our analysis towards those views that also seek to disprove the gender pay gap. That being said, the number of disproving videos suggests that the negativity seen the in comments can still be attributed to the dataset as a whole. </p>

<p> The negativity of videos is also consistent with previous researching showing that youtube users create echo chambers were similar content proliferates (Bessi et al 2016). As such, before we analysed the content associated with the videos, there was evidence that these videos represented a community of youtube users seeking to disprove the gender pay-gap. As noted, from this set of 100 videos we excluded videos that were not in english or which had no comments, leaving us with 88. </p>
